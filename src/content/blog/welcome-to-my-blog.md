Welcome to my blog! This is my very first post, where I’d like to introduce myself and share a little bit about how I ended up here.

## Who I Am

My name is **Amir Aman**, and I’m currently a software engineering student at Adama Science and Technology University in Ethiopia.  
Ever since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by computers and technology. Over the years, I’ve explored many hobbies running, chess, drawing, and even content creation (at one point, I dreamed of being a YouTuber). Most of those interests faded, but the one constant that never let go of me was computers.

## My First Encounters with Computers

My first real introduction to a computer was in my father’s office. It was an old desktop with **512 MB of RAM, an 80 GB hard drive, and a chunky Acer AF712 monitor**, running none other than Windows 7. Every chance I got, I’d sneak in to explore it, though I often got frustrated when actual work interrupted my experiments.

Things escalated in 7th grade, when my school introduced computer classes. We had **15 machines for 45 students**, which meant three kids per computer. Even though it was a private school, resources were still limited. Friends from public schools told me they didn’t even have labs at the time. Still, those thirty minutes in the lab became the highlight of my week. Since I already knew my way around the basics, I was often the one at the keyboard, rushing through assignments and occasionally earning bonus points.

In 8th grade, my father brought that old office computer home and set it up in my room. My obsession grew to the point that my family limited me to **two hours per day**, and I made sure to use every minute. I explored every corner of Windows, every bundled game, and every tool. I even became strangely good at Minesweeper. I’d watch YouTube tutorials in internet cafés and then try to recreate what I saw once I was back home.

Of course, two hours never felt like enough. In one of my more creative hacks, I started **pushing back the household clocks** by fifteen minutes, just to squeeze in a little extra time before anyone noticed. Things really changed when I got my first **USB stick**-suddenly I could transfer files, tutorials, and even cracked software between cafés and my machine, and my exploration shifted into overdrive.

That same summer, my father enrolled me in proper computer classes. I quickly realized that computers were much more than just games and Microsoft Office. Since I already had the basics down, I dove straight into **binary systems, logic gates, system maintenance, and even programming**. That’s when I first touched Java, so technically, yes, Java was my first language (though I probably didn’t appreciate it at the time).

## Discovering Programming

High school was a turning point. YouTube had become a goldmine of tutorials, and I discovered the world of **web development**. I started experimenting with JavaScript, Node.js, and later moved on to frameworks like React and Next.js. Eventually, I even built a few small websites for local businesses, including a pharmacy and a motel.

College expanded my horizons even further. I realized programming is much bigger than just shipping React projects or deploying apps. My perspective matured: programming languages and frameworks are just **tools** - they’re not the end goal. They’re the medium to translate solutions into working systems. That, to me, is what being an engineer is all about: solving problems with the right tools for the job.

## Where I Am Now

Sure, I still take on the occasional freelance gig (if the price is right), but what drives me now is becoming a **better problem solver**. The deeper I go into this journey, the more I realize that software engineering isn’t about memorizing syntax or chasing the next hot framework, it’s about the **craft of designing systems, thinking critically, and building things that actually matter**.

## Conclusion

This blog is where I’ll share my journey including my thoughts, experiments, and lessons learned along the way. Expect a mix of **personal reflections, technical deep-dives, and maybe even some media recommendations**.
